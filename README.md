# CPE-490-Final-Project
For our final project in CPE 490, we were to write a proposal, pick a data set and create a machine learning model to tackle an issue or something we wanted to do and write an final paper discussing our model and the results.

To test the code on your own, first you should download the "Salary Data.csv", and you should also download the Jupiter notebook. I used google collab to write and test this code since VSCODE on windows and linux had some issue with missing packages, so you should create a new notebook or upload this and the dataset to google collab and run it to see the results.
